# JAMgularBlog

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.12.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Scully - How to run locally
 - Run `ng build` or `ng build --watch` to build the angular app
 - Run `npm run scully -- --scanRoutes` to scan the Routes (have to run whenever new routes are there)
 - Run `npm run scully` (have to run after building the app)
 - Run `npm run scully -- --watch`
 - If the above commend didn't open in watch mode, then Run `npm run scully:serve` and open Scully [Static server](http://localhost:1668/) 
 - set `build:scully` as a command for production to start the app in the server

## Troubleshooting
### How to kill server when seeing “EADDRINUSE: address already in use”

1. To find the process id (PID) associated with the port

```shell
lsof -i tcp:1668
```

It'll display as below. Please note down the PID from that

```bash
COMMAND PID   USER  FD  TYPE DEVICE                SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
node   44475 chen5 31u IPv4 0x8b1721168764e4bf 0t0 TCP *:strexec-s (LISTEN)
```

2. Then to kill the process by PID

```bash
kill -9 44475
```
